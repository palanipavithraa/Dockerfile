# Step 1: Use an official Maven runtime to build the application
FROM maven:3.8.5-openjdk-17 AS spring_build

# Step 2: Set the working directory in the container for the build stage
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy the entire project into the container
COPY . .

# Step 4: Run Maven to build the project and package it into a JAR file
RUN mvn clean install -DskipTests

# Step 5: Use an official OpenJDK runtime for running the application
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-alpine

# Step 6: Set the working directory in the container for the runtime stage
WORKDIR /app

# Step 7: Copy the JAR file from the build stage to the runtime stage
COPY --from=spring_build /app/target/bloodx-1.0.0.jar /app/bloodx-1.0.0.jar

# Step 8: Expose the port that the Spring Boot application will run on
EXPOSE 8080

# Step 9: Define the entry point to run the Spring Boot application
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "bloodx-1.0.0.jar"]
